The format and outline I used to create this project are nearly identical to what I am currently in the process of gathering for my masters project studying depredation and cause of death of domestic lambs in Utah. The data I used for this project is both real and fictional, and it is based on what I expect to have gathered at the conclusion of my field season. Some real information I used in the project includes collar serial numbers, rancher names, and some real animal ids. Almost all of the results data is fictional and were generated randomly. In some cases, such as cause of death and predator species, I added arbitrary weights when generating the results in an attempt to create patterns that would make the data usable for the purposes of this class. The remaining data is all random, but it is within the bounds of what could be feasibly seen in my project e.g. dates, geographic locations etc. 1.1 Project Goals The goal of this project is to use what I have learned this semester to create a framework for analysis that I can use once I have acquired the real-world data for my masters. This has been an extrordinarily difficult class for me. I dont know if I am getting old, or dumb, or if my computer was just out to get me because thats how it felt sometimes. I honesly would put this material on par with the top two hardest classes of my undergrad. Im not sure why I have such a difficult time with the material. That being said I think what I did end up learning will be a huge asset to me. Thanks for putting the class together. This final project probably doesnt look like much, but I spent a lot of time on it and Im pretty proud of the very small amount that I completed. The overall objectives of my Masters thesis are to (1) obtain data on cause-specific mortality of sheep and lambs to determine total loss due to predation vs. other causes and (2) classify predator-caused mortalities based on what predator species is responsible. 1.2 Project outline This book contains the following chapters: Chapter 2, Database Structure Chapter 3, Deadstock Loss and Cause of death of domestic range lambs Chapter 4, Proportion of lamb deaths related to predation "],["database-creation.html", "Chapter 2 Database Creation 2.1 Structure 2.2 The following are the steps I used to create my database in SQL Using R", " Chapter 2 Database Creation 2.1 Structure Our goal is to collar approximately 10% of all lambs in the 6 Participating herds of sheep. This equates to approximately 135 collars per band and 800 collars total. When a collar indicates mortality we find the lamb and determine the cause of death using necropsies and DNA evidence. Based on what I learned in this class I created a relational database to organize my data. The structure of the database is shown below.

Predation will be broken down further in the next chapter, but we expect to see the majority of predation events to be caused by coyotes (Canis latrans) cougars (Puma concolor) and black bear (Ursus americanus). I want to know what proportion of collared lambs died from each cause during the monitoring season. killsites %&gt;% group_by(cod) %&gt;% tally() %&gt;% mutate(prop = n/nrow(killsites)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = cod, y = prop, fill = cod))+ geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;)+ theme_light()+ labs(x = &quot;Cause of Death&quot;, y = &quot;Proportion Dead Lambs&quot;, fill = &quot; &quot;)+ theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;)+ scale_fill_manual(values=wes_palette( &quot;IsleofDogs1&quot;)) This is Highly skewed towards predation. In reality the number would be much different. Information like this will be able to guide ranchers where they can best focus their efforts when trying to protect the sheep and their livelihoods, and it can help wildlife managers more effectively manage predators to the benefit of the ranchers and the predators themselves. "],["proportion-of-lamb-deaths-related-to-predation.html", "Chapter 4 Proportion of Lamb Deaths Related to Predation 4.1 Intro 4.2 Predator loss", " Chapter 4 Proportion of Lamb Deaths Related to Predation 4.1 Intro Predation is a major concern for the domestic sheep industry. Advances in synthetic fabrics and a decrease in the demand for lamb and mutton have led to a major decline in the sheep and wool industry in the last century. Increases in predator populations and tighter restrictions on predator control measures also contribute to the hardships that sheep ranchers face. A better understanding of what predators are responsible for sheep and lamb depredations would allow for more targeted predator control efforts and it will help ensure that ranchers are adequately compensated for losses brought about by protected predator species. In this chapter I will try to analyze and show what predators were responsible for what proportion of loss in our fictional collar database. Eventually we will also temporal, spatial and habitat differences as well as predator densities, animal husbandry practices, and other factors as they arise. 4.2 Predator loss In the fictional dataset 125 collared lambs were lost to predation. The main predators of lambs in Utah as mentioned previously are coyotes, cougars, and bears. Eagles, domestic dogs, and other mesopredators are also known to take small lambs, but these numbers are much smaller, and there were none taken by these in the fictional dataset. killsites %&gt;% select(pred_species) %&gt;% filter(pred_species != &quot;na&quot;) %&gt;% unique() ## pred_species ## 1 coyote ## 2 bear ## 3 cougar Now to find what predators are most responsible for lamb loss. predators &lt;- killsites %&gt;% select(pred_species) %&gt;% filter(pred_species !=&quot;na&quot;) %&gt;% group_by(pred_species) %&gt;% tally() predators %&gt;% mutate(prop = n/sum(n)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = pred_species, y = prop, fill = pred_species))+ geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;)+ theme_light()+ labs(x = &quot;Predator Species&quot;, y = &quot;Proportion of Kills&quot;, fill = &quot; &quot;)+ theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;)+ scale_fill_manual(values=wes_palette( &quot;Moonrise2&quot;)) predators %&gt;% mutate(prop = n/sum(n)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = &quot; &quot;, y=prop, fill = pred_species)) + geom_bar(width = 1, stat = &quot;identity&quot;) + theme(axis.line = element_blank(), plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5)) + labs(fill=&quot;Species&quot;, x=NULL, y=NULL, title=&quot;Predators&quot;)+ theme_light()+ scale_fill_manual(values=wes_palette( &quot;Moonrise2&quot;))+ coord_polar(theta = &quot;y&quot;, start=0) It looks like coyotes were lamb enemy number one with cougars a close second. In reality we would probably expect to see the bear and cougar portions to be about half what we see in this dataset. Each rancher will be interested to know how they fared in comparison to the others that participated in the study so I separated the dead lambs by rancher. tagging %&gt;% left_join(killsites, by =&quot;lamb_id&quot;) %&gt;% group_by(rancher) %&gt;% select(killsite_id) %&gt;% filter(killsite_id !=&quot;na&quot;) %&gt;% tally() %&gt;% mutate(proprancher = n/sum(n)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = rancher, y = proprancher, fill = rancher))+ geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;)+ theme_light()+ labs(x = &quot;Rancher&quot;, y = &quot;Total Kills&quot;, fill = &quot; &quot;)+ theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;)+ scale_fill_ordinal() ## Adding missing grouping variables: `rancher` It appears that they all lost almost exactly the same amount of sheep, Almost like someone made up this data. Understanding which predators have the most impact on the domestic lambs can guide efforts to mitigate human and predator conflicts "]]
